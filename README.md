# How We've Divided Tasks
09/01 1. Gone over User Stories and the code we've been provided with together  

09/01 2. Ran through debugger together, sharing screens, asking questions  

09/01 3. Midnight: Wrote part of Display Info  

09/01 4. Figured out how to make Billy Bob display together (with the help of David)  

09/01 5. Divide and conquer tasks   
    - Midnight: finish the display info; individual traits: gender, dob, height, weight  
    - Michael: eye color, occupation, has parent, has spouse  
      
09/01 6. Commit Traits  

09/02 7. Midnight: Get .io diagram in place to help sort and organize content.  

09/02 8. Merged single traits while on screen with one another to acccurately resolve conflicts.  Gave feedback back and forth and kicked around ideas for continuing.  Wrote the algorithm for the next task together.  

09/03 9. Michael wrote next algorithm.  Working on that.  Midnight working on multiple trait search.  On call together and talking back and forth about each element.
