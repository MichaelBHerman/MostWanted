# How We've Divided Tasks
I (Midnight) didn't like the format to how we divided things up and what we both worked on before.  So I'll do it by summary.  We were frequently on Slack call or messaging via Slack through the entire process.  We spent a lot of time going over the existing code together and figuring out how it worked.  For most major merges, we screen shared to try to make sure the merges were accurate.  We divided and conquered the traits.  Small edits throughout.  We wrote most of the algorithms together.  We both did validation for different traits.  


# Commit Comments
09/04 Did a little more quality of life readability edits.  Finished siblings, parents, and spouse.  Only waiting on children/grandchildren.  Tested against a variety of different people in the database and done without refreshing in between to try to ensure no data was changed through any function.  Hopefully I didn't miss anything.   
09/03 Edited for readability and organized traits into the same order throughout.  Removed most comments.  Finsihed with finding spouse and parents.  Half finished with siblings.  
09/03 Finished searching by multiple traits at once.  Need to reorganize where things are as I was working on the bottom, but want to commit first in case I break it!  
09/03 Search by multiple traits partially completed AND working!  
09/02 User validations fixed and tested;  
09/02 Added search by Eye Color, Parents, Spouse, and Occupation.  User validation functions completed as well.
09/02 Finished traits so they can narrow a group down to a single individual; Added exit points to most the traits.  Changed some verbage in how traits were returned to work better in running them through again.  Tested on various individuals.  
09/02 Merged files  
09/02 Added search by DOB, tested and working.  Tested other traits at this point to ensure nothing was accidentally changed.  
09/02 Added search by ID, tested && working;  
09/02 Added weight, tested, working;  
09/02 Added height, tested, working;  
09/02 Added Draw.IO diagram to help keep things straight, merged files, added a few small bits of changes to gender  
09/01 Added search function by gender and returns a list of names for each one  - confirmed male and female  
09/01 Added switch case for traits  
09/01 Added other info (Id, parents, spouse) to "display info"  
09/01 Starting to utilize the README, have commited a few times and starting to get the hang of Git!
